# Spoolman Scanner

Spoolman Scanner is an open-source, static web application designed to help you manage your 3D printing filaments by interfacing with a **Spoolman** instance. It features a modern, responsive dashboard with NFC tag integration for easy spool identification and tracking.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Android Only**: The NFC tag reading and writing features currently only work on **Android devices** using a compatible web browser (like Chrome).
> 
> **CORS Configuration**: Your Spoolman instance must be configured with appropriate CORS settings to allow this static page to connect. For example, if you are using Docker, you may need to set `SPOOLMAN_CORS_ORIGINS="*"`.

## 🚀 Features

- **Spool Dashboard**: Visualize all your filaments at a glance.
- **Advanced Search**: Quickly find filaments by name, vendor, or material.
- **Custom Metadata**: Supports an optional `subtype` string field in Spoolman filament "extra" data for more granular classification.
- **NFC Tag Integration**: 
  - **Scan Tag**: Instantly identify a spool by scanning its NFC tag.
  - **Write Tag**: Encode spool data onto NFC tags for physical tracking.
- **Configurable Settings**: Easily connect to your own Spoolman instance.
- **Fully Responsive**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile use.
